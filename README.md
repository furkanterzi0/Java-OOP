# Java OOP

Java_OOP is a repository focused on demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using Java. This repository includes a variety of examples, exercises, and small projects designed to help users understand key OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Features:
- **Object-Oriented Principles:** Clear examples for core OOP concepts, such as classes, objects, methods, and constructors.
- **Inheritance:** Demonstrating class hierarchies and reusability.
- **Polymorphism:** Implementing method overloading and overriding.
- **Encapsulation:** Using getters and setters for data protection.
- **Abstraction:** Creating abstract classes and interfaces.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for implementing OOP principles.
- **Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA**: Popular IDEs for Java development (or any IDE of your choice).

## Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/furkanterzi0/Java_OOP.git
